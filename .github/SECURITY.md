# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release will be properly supported. To avoid having to update
this with every release, it is only marked as 1.0.x

| Version | Supported          |

| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Presumably, and security issues will lie in the underlying PHP, SSL or cURL
libraries. If a security concern should arise affecting these libraries, please
report the concern to the original project.

Should there be a security issue here, for now simply report that there is a security
concern in an issue without revealing any specifics. You will then be contacted with
further instructions that will likely consist of submitting your concern as an
issue, but PGP encrypted using my public key.
